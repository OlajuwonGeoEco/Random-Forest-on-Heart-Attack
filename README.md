# Random-Forest-on-Heart-Attack

I was seraching online for an interest file to do some classification. And I found this heart data on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/pritsheta/heart-attack

I cleaned the data, and did some initial look up to make sure everything checks out. 

Only transformation I did before analysis was to recode the sex column.

I classifed the data set using sex; ccording to the dataset metadata the thal, and target represents the AHD; ALveolar Hydatid disease. 
Thus our model suggests that according to this dataset, AH disease is largely responsible for Heart attacks.

Perhaps I'll explore this data set on LDA and see the results I get.
